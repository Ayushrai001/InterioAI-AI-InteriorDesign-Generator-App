AI Interior Design Generator App (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)

**Description:**

The AI Interior Design Generator App is a powerful tool that allows users to effortlessly generate interior design concepts for their spaces. By leveraging AI, the app can take input about room type, color scheme, and other preferences, and generate visually stunning room designs based on the user’s specifications.

The app is built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a fast, responsive, and modern user experience. The front end allows users to input details about their room, such as room type (e.g., living room, bedroom, office) and preferred color scheme. Once the user submits their preferences, the app communicates with an AI model to generate a design for them, displaying a realistic image or 3D model of the interior layout.

**Features:**

Room Type Input: Choose the type of room you want to design (e.g., living room, bedroom, kitchen).
Color Scheme Selection: Input a color scheme for the room to match your style.
AI-Powered Design Generation: Leverage advanced AI models (like OpenAI or DALL·E) to create interior design ideas.
Instant Results: Get quick results with a visual representation of your generated design, including furniture placement, color palette, and more.
Simple UI/UX: A clean, modern interface designed with Tailwind CSS to ensure responsiveness on mobile and desktop devices.
Seamless Backend: Uses Next.js API routes to communicate with the backend, fetching design results from the AI model.
